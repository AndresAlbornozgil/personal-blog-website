# Personal Blog Website

## Description
A personal blog website where users can input and view blog posts. It's important for a blog website to display user entries as blog post since the main purpose of a blog is for users to share their input as well as read other user's inputs. This allows for people to share their toughts and ideas with one another. By building this project I learned about the importance of localStorage in web development.
